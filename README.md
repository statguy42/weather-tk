# Weather-tk, a very basic weather app

I am working on this project only as a learning experience.

Everything in this repo is licensed under the MIT license.

## Dependencies
- python 3 (duh)
- tkinter
- an openweathermap API key

More dependencies may be added as the proeject goes on

## How to run
- You will need an API key from openweathermap, you can get one for free in their website by creating an account.
- Copy and paste your API key in a file named `api_key.txt` and place it in the same directory as `weather-tk.py`
- Then simply run `python weather-tk.py`

## Roadmap
- add multithreading so that the UI doesn't freeze when getting data from the API
- add weather icons
- add daily forecast for 7 days
- add hourly forecast for 24 hours

This project is open to suggestions and pull requests.
